Experimental graphics
=====================

Today I decided that I need to make my experimental artwork more accessible to myself primarily, and in the process make the code more accessible to others.

Experimental and generative art involves rapid tweaking of the idea; constants, variables and functions mutate on the fly towards an unclear vision. This often leads to messy code, bizarre mathematics, uncommented oddities and disfunctional /* commented out */ blocks. Perhaps in the process of putting this code in the public sphere extra effort will be engaged to make this work presentable.
